      <h3><b><u>Skills</u></b></h3>
      <p>Students enrolled in the bachelor’s degree in Information Technology learn a wide range of technical skills and study latest industry concepts. The Information Technology Capstone Program expects student teams to collaborate, plan, design, and execute tasks to achieve goals and milestones for a project.</p>
      <p>Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines
to identify solutions. Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.</p>
      <p>Intermediate understanding of project management skills and concepts are needed to drive a project to successful completion. Practical understanding of applicable technical skills such as programming, systems analysis, database management, and cybersecurity to name but a few are instrumental skillsets that are commonplace in Capstone projects</p>

<div><h3><b><u>Timeframe</u></b></h3>
      <p>The Capstone covers two semesters, roughly 36 weeks to complete. Student teams will manage the level of effort and hours needed to complete their sponsor projects. The project schedule, as part of the project plan, is created by the student teams to track deliverables and project milestones to be completed.</p>
      <p>The measurement to successful project delivery and completion is dependent on the number of hours pooled into the tasks contributing to overall project progress. The projected number of hours per semester is calculated below:</p>
          <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; IT 492 — 9-10 hours a week for the 3-credit IT 492 class each semester</p>
          <p>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; IT 493 — 12-16 hours a week for the IT 493 4-credit semester.</p>
        
      <br>
      <h3><b><u>Team Composition:</u></b></h3>
      <p>Students will be organized in teams based on their concentrations, strengths, and skillsets. Teams can consist of about 5-7 members at best although it could vary at the instructor’s discretion. Among the members, roles and responsibilities will be assigned and each team member is expected to fulfill these responsibilities as part of their equal contribution to team.</p>
