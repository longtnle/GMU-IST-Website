		<h3><b><u>Project Sponsorship Benefits:</u></b></h3>
      			<p>Organizations who sponsor a project will receive technical assistance from George Mason University at no cost. Student teams will engage sponsors on matters related to 			improving and enhancing business processes with the help of information technology. The level of effort will be undertaken by five to seven students in a team for roughly 35 			weeks where they are expected to contribute 18 hours per week on average to the project. You have the opportunity to mentor and guide students as they grow professionally 			throughout the capstone.</p>

      		<h3><b><u>Sponsor Role:</u></b></h3>
      		<p>Sponsors play an important role in the Capstone Program as they are the stakeholders to student teams, thus being integral to course success.</p>
      		<p>The Capstone Programâ€™s learning objective is to provide students the professional realism of working with an external organization representing George Mason University. Sponsors 		will give students specific real-world business requirements that need information technology solutions. Satisfying these requirements will be the making of a capstone-worthy 			project. Student teams will work closely with sponsors to plan all the project elements, such as the current business processes and to research the viability of future state (to-be) 		solutions to real-world problems. Communications, teamwork, professionalism, and ethics will be the staple qualities that create strong relationships between the sponsor and the 		student.</p>
